# In Maintenance

DuckDuckHack is now in maintenance mode. We are only accepting pull requests for essential bug fixes. For more information see [duckduckhack.com](https://duckduckhack.com).

## What are essential bug fixes?

Any changes necessary to keep existing Instant Answers functioning correctly and as expected. For example:

  - Updating the URL for a Spice Instant Answer when the API changes
  - Correcting a Perl or JavaScript logic error
  - Fixing CSS that's causing the display to break

Any other changes will not be accepted. For example:

  - spelling/comment changes
  - unsolicited improvements, changes, and code refactoring
